# Terrorism Prediction through Twitter Analysis #

Nowadays social media is creating a great impact. Any incident is witnessed on social media before recording organizations, even the weather changes are noticed on social media before any weather forecasting agency measured them.

## ALGORITHMIC STEPS ##
1- I made a dictionary of terrorism words. 

Posts containing those words will be extracted from twitter based on
countries



The level of Happiness, Sadness and Anger of each post will be 
calculated



Country wise threshold of Happiness, Sadness and Anger of twitter 
posts will be calculated



Country wise No of anti-Islamic posts will be calculated

Based on the thresholds and numbers it can be analyzed that which 
country has the highest probability of a terrorist attack

This study is very practical and can be verified by getting tweets 
before the Paris attack

# Terrorism Prediction through Twitter Analysis #

Nowadays social media is creating a great impact. Any incident is witnessed on social media before recording organizations, even the weather changes are noticed on social media before any weather forecasting agency measured them.

## ALGORITHMIC STEPS ##
1- I made a dictionary of terrorism words. For each word I fetched the tweets containing those words for specified Geographical locations.

2- Twitter REST API is used for fetching tweets.

3- Famous cities are used for getting geography based tweets. Geographical locations are specified by the Latitude/Longitude of city and a radius value.

4- Each query fetches dictionary matching tweets from the specified Geographical area.

5- The collected tweet data is uploaded [here.]: https://github.com/YumnaBatool/TerrorismPrediction/tree/master/API_Data

6- 

The level of Happiness, Sadness and Anger of each post will be 
calculated



Country wise threshold of Happiness, Sadness and Anger of twitter 
posts will be calculated



Country wise No of anti-Islamic posts will be calculated

Based on the thresholds and numbers it can be analyzed that which 
country has the highest probability of a terrorist attack

This study is very practical and can be verified by getting tweets 
before the Paris attack
